# Adding a New Agent, Handler, and Listener

Use this guide when you need to stand up a fresh agent type and plumb it through the Ankou stack (server ↔ ghost relay ↔ agent) for the first time.

## 1. Know the Moving Pieces
- **Server** stores state, enforces auth, and exposes both GraphQL and REST endpoints (see `server/main.go` for the `Listener` model, `AgentHandler`, and the `/api/register` handler).
- **Ghost Relay** terminates transports, injects the `X-Agent-Type` header on behalf of the agent, and re-signs traffic with HMAC before forwarding (`ghost-relay/accept.go`).
- **Agents** live under `agents/` and are regular Go programs that register, poll, and push command output (use `agents/geist/main.go` as the reference template).

Everything hinges on three configuration touch points:
1. Shared HMAC secret
2. HTTPS listener that the relay talks to
3. Agent handler metadata so the server knows how to translate commands

## 2. Align the Shared Secrets
1. Start the server once so it generates `server/hmac.key`. You can also supply `HMAC_KEY` via environment variables at runtime (`server/main.go`).
2. Copy that same hex value into the relay and the agent:
   - Relay: export `RELAY_HMAC_KEY` before launching (`ghost-relay/internal/config/config.go`).
   - Agent: set the `hmacKeyHex` constant in your agent's config block (see `agents/geist/main.go`).
3. If you regenerate the key later, restart the server, relay, and rebuild the agent with the new value so everyone agrees.

## 3. Provision an HTTPS Listener
The server only accepts agent traffic on listeners. You can create one through the UI or by dropping a JSON file under `server/listeners/`.

- Each listener file is shaped like:

```json
{
  "id": "listener_1760913734",
  "name": "wiki",
  "type": "https",
  "endpoint": "/wiki",
  "status": "stopped",
  "description": "Primary agent ingress",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-27T00:00:00Z"
}
```

- Fields map directly to the `Listener` struct (`server/main.go`). Only `https` is supported today (`server/listeners.go`).
- Always normalize the endpoint with a leading slash. The helper in `server/listeners.go` shows the accepted formats.
- After creating the file, either restart the server or trigger `createListener` via GraphQL so `loadListenersFromConfig()` (`server/listeners.go`) picks it up.
- Start the listener (UI: "Start"; CLI: GraphQL `startListener` mutation). It will listen with the TLS certificate created in step 2.

The relay's `UPSTREAM_URL` (in `relay.config`) or `GHOST_RELAY_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` environment variable must point at the base C2 server URL (without the listener endpoint), e.g. `https://c2.example.com:8444`. The relay will automatically append the listener endpoint path (e.g., `/wiki`) when forwarding requests.

## 4. Register an Agent Handler
Handlers live in `server/agent_handlers/` and let the server match an incoming agent to a feature set.

1. Create a JSON file named after your handler, e.g. `handler_myagent.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "handler_myagent",
     "agentName": "myagent",
     "agentHttpHeaderId": "myagent",
     "supportedCommands": ["ls", "exec", "reconnect"],
     "commandMappings": {
       "ls": "1",
       "exec": "7",
       "reconnect": "8"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Field reference:
   - `id` – optional; autogenerated if omitted (`server/agent_handlers.go`).
   - `agentName` – display name shown in the UI.
   - `agentHttpHeaderId` – lowercase identifier injected by the relay as `X-Agent-Type`; must match the relay binding in step 5.
   - `supportedCommands` – string list surfaced to operators (`server/agent_handlers.go` sanitizes for duplicates).
   - `commandMappings` – optional map for translating UI commands to agent-native opcodes. When present, `translateCommand()` swaps the first token before the task is queued (`server/agent_handlers.go`).
   - `createdAt` – RFC3339 timestamp; purely informational.
3. Restart the server or call the `upsertAgentHandler` GraphQL mutation with the same JSON so `loadAgentHandlersFromConfig()` (`server/agent_handlers.go`) registers it at runtime.

If your agent needs additional metadata, extend both `AgentHandler` (server) and the JSON schema to keep everything in sync.

### Handler-to-Agent Relationships
- Handlers are indexed by `agentHttpHeaderId` via `agentHandlersByHeader` (`server/agent_handlers.go`). When the relay forwards traffic it adds `X-Agent-Type` with that ID, letting the server pick the right handler even when multiple agents beacon at once.
- A single handler can back any number of binaries as long as they emit the same `X-Agent-Type`. This is how you ship variants (e.g., different OS builds) without duplicating configuration.
- If you need distinct command sets or mappings for agents that share transport but diverge in capabilities, create additional handler JSON files with unique header IDs and adjust the relay bindings accordingly.

## 5. Implement the Agent
Use the existing agents as blueprints. Even if you introduce a new transport, the runtime contract between agent, relay, and server is consistent.

1. **Define runtime parameters**  
   Mirror the config block that Geist exposes: protocol selector, relay host/port, listener endpoint, reconnect interval, jitter window, and `hmacKeyHex`. Persist these values in constants or a struct so both the network layer and your command loop can reuse them.

2. **Produce HMAC-authenticated envelopes**  
   Every interaction with the relay must carry the headers `X-Timestamp` (Unix seconds) and `X-Signature` (hex HMAC-SHA256). Geist centralises this in `signRequest()`, which takes the HTTP verb, canonical listener path (for example `/wiki/api/register`), and exact JSON body before hashing with the shared key.  
   - For native HTTP transports, attach the headers directly and POST to the listener URL.  
   - For custom transports (QUIC, DNS, SSH, etc.) pack the verb/path/body/timestamp/signature into your protocol frame. The relay will unpack that frame and replay the original POST upstream via `sendToC2()` in `ghost-relay/accept.go`.

3. **Register the implant**  
   Serialize the `AgentRegistration` struct defined in `server/main.go`:  
   ```jsonc
   {
     "uuid": "<agent GUID>",
     "name": "<operator-facing label>",
     "ip": "<current outward-facing IP>",
     "os": "<runtime.GOOS runtime.GOARCH>",
     "reconnectInterval": <seconds>
   }
   ```  
   Dispatch this payload through your transport to the relay's `/api/register` route and verify a 200 response before proceeding.

4. **Implement the beacon loop**  
   Use the reconnect interval plus jitter to control your polling cadence. Geist's `subscribeToCommands()` calculates a new jittered duration for each loop, then calls `getPendingCommands()` which issues a signed request to `/api/poll`. The relay forwards the call, the server updates heartbeat timestamps, and returns an array of pending commands. Follow this pattern so reconnect updates from operators propagate automatically.

5. **Map supported commands to execution logic**  
   `supportedCommands` in the handler config advertises capabilities to the UI, so your agent must honour each verb. Geist routes commands through `handleBuiltinCommand()` and exposes helpers such as `handleLs`, `handlePut`, and `handleExec`. Replicate that structure: parse the command string, dispatch to the correct implementation, and return stdout/stderr plus any metadata (loot entries, hashes, status strings).

6. **Send command responses (and loot) back upstream**  
   Wrap the results in the `CommandResponse` schema (`commandId`, `output`, `status`). For file transfers or directory listings that surface loot, set the `type` header to `loot` and provide a JSON payload in `loot-data`; the relay copies both into the HTTPS request so `server/main.go` can archive the entries. Ensure each response is HMAC-signed with the same procedure used during registration and polling.

> **Heads-up:** Many agents will never open a direct HTTPS connection to the C2 server. Instead, they speak their native protocol to a relay handler which performs the HTTP translation and HMAC signing on their behalf. Geist's QUIC client is one example, but the same pattern applies to DNS, ICMP, or any custom module you add under `ghost-relay/internal/accept/`.

Build the agent with `go build ./agents/myagent` and ship the resulting binary with the correct config values baked in.

## 6. Bind the Agent in the Ghost Relay (Only for New Transports)
If your agent can reuse an existing relay transport (HTTPS/Phantasm, HTTP/3 QUIC/Geist, SSH/Shade, SMB/WebSocket/Wraith), simply point that handler at your new `AgentType` and skip to verification. Only build a new `accept_*.go` module when you introduce a protocol the relay does not already support. If you're in that situation, follow the detailed recipe in [docs/ghost-relay-new-transport.md](ghost-relay-new-transport.md).

When you do need a fresh transport, copy the pattern from `ghost-relay/accept_geist.go`:

```go
func setupMyAgentHandler(ctx context.Context, tlsConfig *tls.Config) {
	cfg := &accept.HandlerConfig{
		UpstreamURL:      cfg.UpstreamBaseURL.String(),
		Timeout:          int(cfg.ClientTimeout.Seconds()),
		InsecureTLS:      cfg.InsecureSkipVerify,
		RequestReadLimit: cfg.RequestReadLimit,
		AgentType:        "myagent",
	}

	myHandler := accept.NewQUICHandler(sendToC2, logger, cfg, tlsConfig)
	go func() {
		if err := myHandler.Start(ctx, "0.0.0.0:8085"); err != nil {
			logger.Printf("MyAgent handler error: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	logger.Printf("✓ Registered myagent transport (QUIC on :8085)")
}
```

- The `AgentType` here must match the handler's `agentHttpHeaderId`.
- For HTTP-family transports you can call `BaseHandler.RegisterEndpoints()` to expose `/api/register`, `/api/poll`, etc. automatically (`ghost-relay/internal/accept/base.go`).
- Register your new setup function inside `setupAcceptHandlers()` (`ghost-relay/accept.go`).

> **Tip:** Only add a new relay transport when you introduce a protocol we do not already ship. Built-in handlers cover HTTPS (Phantasm), HTTP/3 QUIC (Geist), SSH (Shade), and SMB/WebSocket (Wraith). Reuse those when possible and just point them at your handler by setting the correct `AgentType`.

Once the relay is running, any request the agent makes through this transport gets re-signed with the shared HMAC (`ghost-relay/accept.go`) and forwarded to the listener you created earlier.

## 7. Verify End-to-End
1. Start/restart the server so it loads the new listener and handler.
2. Launch the relay with `UPSTREAM_URL` in `relay.config` (or `GHOST_RELAY_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` env var) set to the base C2 server URL (e.g., `https://c2.example.com:8444`) and the correct `SERVER_HMAC_KEY` matching the server's `HMAC_KEY`.
3. Deploy the agent, confirm successful registration (`registerAgent` log on the server) and heartbeat updates (`server/main.go`).
4. Run a test command from the operator UI, confirm it executes, and check translation if you rely on `commandMappings`.
5. Inspect `loot/` for any artifacts captured by the agent (`server/loot.go` handles storage).

With these pieces in place you can iterate on either side (new transports or new agent capabilities) without touching the rest of the system.
