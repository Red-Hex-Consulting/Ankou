# Ghost Relay Configuration Example
# Copy this file to relay.config and fill in the values
#
# The relay acts as a middleman between agents and the C2 server.

# ========================================
# UPSTREAM C2 SERVER
# ========================================
# URL of the C2 server relay endpoint (must use https://)
UPSTREAM_URL=https://localhost:8444

# ========================================
# HMAC KEYS
# ========================================
# The relay needs TWO different HMAC keys for security:
#
# 1. AGENT_HMAC_KEY - Shared with agents to validate their incoming requests
#    - Agents sign their requests with this key
#    - Relay validates agent signatures with this key
#    - Generate a unique key for agents (NOT the same as server key!)
#
# 2. SERVER_HMAC_KEY - Shared with C2 server to sign relay->server requests
#    - Relay signs forwarded requests with this key
#    - Server validates relay signatures with this key
#    - MUST match the HMAC_KEY in the server's ankou.config
#
# To get the server's HMAC key:
# 1. On the C2 server: cat ankou.config
# 2. Copy the HMAC_KEY value
# 3. Paste it below as SERVER_HMAC_KEY

# Agent HMAC Key (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
AGENT_HMAC_KEY=1bb1a2912f7e02e259f969d96357bb84c2c0bf954a0d8674c45ed903bb674b23

# Server HMAC Key (copy from server's ankou.config)
SERVER_HMAC_KEY=e023ab246af3d5fa0cfd75f1eff012c3e02d081b34f0620982660ae905756975
